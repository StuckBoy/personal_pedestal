<h1>About Me</h1>
I'm a software developer born and raised in Southwest Michigan. I graduated
from Marcellus High School, a small farming town I lived about 10 minutes away
from.

After high school, I attended college at Northern Michigan University where I
obtained a degree in Mobile Web & Application Development, with a minor in Math.
