		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>
			I'm a software developer born and raised in Southwest Michigan. I
			graduated from Marcellus High School, a small farming town I lived about
			10 minutes away from. I was a very active athlete during high school,
			participating in Football, Basketball, and Track all 4 years. I also
			was a member of the marching, concert, and jazz bands during that time.
		</p>

		<p>
			After high school, I attended college at Northern Michigan University in
			Marquette, where I obtained a degree in Mobile Web & Application
			Development, with a minor in Math.
		</p>

		<p>
			The following summer after graduating from NMU, I helped on my family's
			farm until I accepted a position at BluJay Solutions as a Software
			Engineer 1. I am still currently employed by them, and assist in
			developing functionality for their Customs Management application.
